# facilib library

This is a fairly simple library for general purpose and use. A lot of things are simpler because I still do not know use generics (as the use of various functions of input).

The repeat function was deleted because I found out a String::repeat() function. Surely is better use a function alrwady available in a crate. The banner() was reimplemented using String::repeat().

All comments was translated to English.
